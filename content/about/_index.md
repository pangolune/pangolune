# About Pangolune

Pangolune is a serial fantasy adventure fiction. All content is orginal.

In this world of articulate animals, an anxious young chicken named Pango wants
to liberate his father from political imprisonment. The political faction that
imprisoned his father rules the country of Hunistan without opposition, and
Pango is sure they are coming for him too, but what can he do? He's one land
fowl. His fantastical hope is to find an enchanted fruit at the end of the world
that will grant him invincibility and unlimited power, with which he can
reclaim his homeland and liberate his father. You'll have to read to the end to
find out whether this fruit is real, whether Pango can get it into his beak, and
whether he'll ever see his father again. [Start reading!](/1)
